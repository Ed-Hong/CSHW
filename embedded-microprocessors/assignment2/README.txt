Questions 1 - 3 use "file.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o bin/file src/file.cpp

The program accepts as a command line argument the name of the input file to be read. 
For example, if the input file is called "nums" then the following terminal command starts the program:
./bin/file nums

Note that the input file is assumed to be of the same format and structure as the "nums" example file 
included in assignment 2.

Question 4 uses "endianness.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o bin/endianness src/endianness.cpp

The program is then run with the following terminal command:
./bin/endianness

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5 uses "timing.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o bin/timing src/timing.cpp

The program is then run with the following terminal command:
./bin/timing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6 uses "recursive.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o bin/recursive src/recursive.cpp

The program is then run with the following terminal command:
./bin/recursive
