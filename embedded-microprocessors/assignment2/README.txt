Questions 1 - 3 use "file.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o file file.cpp

The program accepts as a command line argument the name of the input file to be read. 
For example, if the input file is called "nums" then the following terminal command starts the program:
./file nums

Note that the input file is assumed to be of the same format and structure as the "nums" example file 
included in assignment 2.

Question 4 uses "endianness.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o endianness endianness.cpp

The program is then run with the following terminal command:
./endianness

Question 5 uses "timing.cpp". The program is compiled using gcc with the following terminal command:
g++ -o timing timing.cpp

The program is then run with the following terminal command:
./timing
