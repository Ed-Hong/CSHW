Producer function should produce the sum of 1000 random numbers in the range [0, 1) divided by 500.
Producer function should produce 1,000,000 of the above values.

// Producer pseudo-code
for(1 million iterations) {
    for(1 thousand iterations) {
        sum += random[0, 1)
    }
    avg = sum/500
    post(avg)
}

Note that post is a thread-safe method which is accessing a shared store of the values 
which may also be accessed by the Consumer threads

Note on generating the random number: One way to do it is to do
    rand() / (RAND_MAX+1.0)

There are 10 consumer pthreads which consume one value at a time and is added to their individual totals.

// Consumer
wait for a post
receive a post
consume the post by adding the value to the running total  

As mentioned above, note that receiving/consuming a post must be thread safe as the Consumer thread
will read a value in from the same shared store of values. In other words, the Consumer pthreads release their lock
when no values remain in the store, so that the Producer can post a new value. 

Output the each pthreads' / consumers' total.



Note: Refer to Figure 5.14 in the Text for an example utilizing Semaphores
- Remember that the producer should produce precisely 1,000,000 values, and thus terminates. 
- Similarily, the consumers should also terminate; they will know when production has finished.

Notes on semaphores - refer to the man page:
sem_t *n;
n = sem_open(name, oflag, mode, initVal)    // set the mode to be S_IRWXU for read, write, and execute permissions

sem_unlink()    // removes a created semaphores
sem_wait()      // decrements (locks) the semaphore
sem_post()      // increments (unlocks) the semaphore

Notes on parbegin - refer to the pthread_create man page's example:
