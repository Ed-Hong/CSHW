* Slide 47 in Ch8 pp
* Memory Trace - represented by an array of 1,000 data values
* each Trace is 1,000 addresses
* Trace generation Pseudo code:
for(int part from 0 to 9)
    var base = 25 * uniform(0,99)
    for(index = 0; index < 100; index++)
        trace[100*part+index] = base + uniform(0,99)

// Uniform random distribution within range [lo, hi]
int uniform(int lo, int hi) {
    int x;
    while((x = random()/(high-low+1)) > (high-low));
    return x + low;
})
